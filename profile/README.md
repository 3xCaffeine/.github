## 3xcaffeine

Haaloooo! Welcome to 3xcaffeine - our little corner of GitHub where we dump our hackathon projects, collab efforts, and random stuff that we may work on. Makes it easier for us to track, collab and iterate xD 

We're just a bunch of uni students who probably have too much caffeine (makes sense given the org name lmaoo) and ~~too many~~ ideas bouncing around. This org is basically our playground for:

- Hackathon projects
- Collab experiments (when we somehow convince each other to work together)
- Random side projects (because why not add another thing to the todo list)
- Learning stuff (because apparently we need to graduate someday)
- Get jobs in this economy T_T

Most of our code is probably held together with duct tape and caffeine, but hey, it works (most of the time). Feel free to poke around, steal ideas, or just judge our questionable code choices, implementations.

If you're into hackathons, late-night coding sessions, or just want to see what happens when sleep-deprived students get access to IDEs, you're in the right place.

Catch us at the next hackathon or scroll through our repos at 3am when you should be studying.
